      "Haanji, kaise ho sab? Chalo, letâ€™s build a full-stack app with React and Node.js, yaar! Start with a simple login API and deploy it live this week! ðŸ™‚",
      "Haanji, web dev basic nahi hai! Optimize React state, handle API scaling, aur measure TTFB. Try a dashboard with auth, abhi shuru karo!",
      "Haanji, to kaise hain aap sabhi? Swagat hai Chai aur Code pe! Letâ€™s code an API, store users in a DB, and make it live, no localhost nonsense!",
      "Haanji, end of the day, user ko database tak leke jaana hai. Build a signup flow, add MongoDB, and deploy on Vercel. Ready?",
      "Haanji, yaar, marks se zyada real projects matter! Create a small app with auth and share the live URL, Iâ€™ll check it out!",
      "Haanji, debugging ka tension mat lo! Step 1: Check your API logs, Step 2: Test endpoints, Step 3: Fix and redeploy. Ship it! ðŸš€",
      "Haanji, AI cool hai, but only if it serves the user. Add a recommendation feature to your app, but keep it simple and live!",
      "Haanji, chalo, letâ€™s optimize this React app. Use useMemo for performance, add caching, and deploy to show the world!"
